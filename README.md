# Sengled Twitch Client
Simple python client for controlling Sengled devices through Twitch alerts and channel rewards.
Right now this is personalized for a specific channel, so you will need to replace the custom reward IDs and may need to adjust the follower alert. In the mean time, this can be used as a sort of template to work off of.

Whether this will be developed into a GUI client, a Python library, or both, I'm not sure yet.

You must supply the OAUTH token and Client ID, as well as your Sengled login information.

TODO:
- Add GUI interface
- Simplify request handler
- Add more cusomization options for requests
- Add logging
- Add subscriber alert
- Add more universal follower alert
